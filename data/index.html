    <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
    <p>
      This Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) report for Acme Corporation reveals the hidden patterns of collaboration,
      communication, and knowledge sharing within the company. The analysis highlights the informal networks that drive performance
      and identifies opportunities to improve cross-functional engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key findings include a highly centralized communication structure in the Engineering department and underutilized knowledge hubs
      in the HR and Customer Success teams.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="network-structure" class="section">
    <h1>Network Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The network map shows a high-density cluster within Product Development, with several key influencers acting as communication
      bridges to other departments. The Sales and Marketing teams operate largely in silos, with minimal cross-talk outside of formal
      meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Centrality metrics reveal:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>John M.</strong> (Engineering) has the highest degree centrality.</li>
        <li><strong>Sara K.</strong> (Design) plays a critical bridging role (high betweenness).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and Compliance</strong> teams show low integration across the network.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="collaboration-insights" class="section">
    <h1>Collaboration Insights</h1>
    <p>
      Informal communication is strongest within teams but weaker across functions. The Engineering and Design teams show strong
      internal collaboration but lack regular interaction with Sales and Support. This limits customer feedback integration into
      product development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top collaborators are often those not in formal leadership roles, indicating the need to recognize and support hidden leaders.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="leadership-recommendations" class="section">
    <h1>Leadership Recommendations</h1>
    <p>
      To improve knowledge flow and innovation:
      <ul>
        <li>Empower informal leaders with mentorship or coordination roles.</li>
        <li>Establish cross-functional working groups, especially between Product, Sales, and Support.</li>
        <li>Incentivize collaboration across department boundaries in performance evaluations.</li>
        <li>Foster psychological safety to encourage sharing of ideas and concerns, especially among peripheral nodes.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="action-plan" class="section">
    <h1>Action Plan</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Quarter 1:</strong> Identify informal leaders using centrality metrics. Organize workshops and cross-team projects.<br>
      <strong>Quarter 2:</strong> Launch mentorship initiatives. Begin pilot of cross-functional teams.<br>
      <strong>Quarter 3:</strong> Measure improvements in communication density. Gather employee feedback.<br>
      <strong>Quarter 4:</strong> Roll out company-wide programs and re-run ONA to assess impact.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="appendix" class="section">
    <h1>Appendix & Methodology</h1>
    <p>
      This ONA used anonymized metadata from Slack, email logs, and employee surveys collected over 90 days. No message content was
      reviewed. The following metrics were used:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Degree Centrality:</strong> Number of direct connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Betweenness Centrality:</strong> Frequency of acting as a bridge between nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Closeness Centrality:</strong> Average distance to all other nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Density:</strong> Ratio of actual connections to possible connections.</li>
      </ul>
